            <p>
                I'm a senior studying Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I'm wrapping up my co-op program at <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT Lincoln Laboratory</a>, and am open to internships for the summer of 2025 and full-time positions in May 2026.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, you'll probably catch me at the gym, on the Taekwondo mat, or on a sand volleyball court (burning my retinas trying to follow the ball in the air). I'm also into video games, playing jazz saxophone, and watching anime.
