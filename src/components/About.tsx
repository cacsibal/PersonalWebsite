                I'm a senior studying Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I'm wrapping up my co-op program at <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">MIT Lincoln Laboratory</a>, and am open to internships for the summer of 2025 and full-time positions in May 2026.
            </p>

                In my free time, you'll probably catch me at the gym, on the Taekwondo mat, or on a sand volleyball court (burning my retinas trying to follow the ball in the air). I'm also into video games, playing jazz saxophone, and watching anime.
